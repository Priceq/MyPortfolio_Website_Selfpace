               <strong><small>“My best skill was that I was coachable. I was a sponge and aggressive to learn.” - Michael Jordan</small></strong>
               <p>I got my first job back in university. It was the second semester of my freshman year and I had received a call from my universirty that I needed to report to the campus's Business Office. I can vividly remember being confused but still anxious to know why I was being summoned.
                  I climbed what felt like never ending stairs and made my way through the squeaky hallways of the historic building. I poked my head through the door and was ushered in by a woman sitting behind her desk. "You can have a seat," she said. 
                  "I'll be with you in a moment." The next few sentences she would speak with me would play a very instrumental role in my desire for success. I was told that a student loan that I had applied for months prior. I was given the ultimatum to pay a hefty lump-sum by a certain time or be forced
                  to leave the school. At the moment, it was a moment of disbelief. I grew up believing that college was the only way to escape poverty, though with no financial support, I was not willing to give up what I had spent years dreaming of. I had no skills. I had no knowledge of how to build a
                  resume. But I was not going home. I applied to various campus jobs hoping that one would reach out to me. None ever did. One night, I sat and had dinner alone. Overwhelmed, I prepared myself to leave. On my way out of the eating quarters I decided to try my luck with the kitchen. I awkwardly
                  approached a server and asked if they were hiring. She responded that she didn't know but recommended to stay put while she went fetch someone that could give me a better answer. Out came a lady in a bright red shirt with a hair net that was covering only half of her hair. She invited me through 
                  two big gray metal doors and into this factory like kitchen that had a hidden office. She asked if I was looking for work and I answered that I was. "Ok, you're just in time. Orientation starts next week. You're on dishes." <br>
                  It was the worst job I had ever worked. Every night I went home covered in dish water and food. But I learned the importance of working hard. Here I developed the idea that everything you do has a process and with proper technique, effeciency can be achieved. I can not exagerate the amount of shifts 
                  that I was left alone to take care of the entire dining shift by myself. But I was comfortable with the process that I had established and made sure that I worked hard. Additionally, it was here that I learned that though the job was doing dishes, it gave me skills that could be translated into
                  other areas of work. The next semester I was determined to work as a fundraiser for my university. So students like me could the financial support that they needed. I applied for only that job, because I was determined that I would get that job. I interviewed and was hired. It was only upward from there.
                  Today, through hard work, my studies, and the trust of the companies that I have had the pleasure to work for I have developed many skills. These skills are, but not limited to, as follows: <strong> Change Management, Content Design, CSS/HTML, Google Worskpace, Data Loader, Excel/Word, Jira Ticketing, Onboarding, Project Management, Python, Salesforce, SQL, and Training. </strong>

                  I've had the opportunity to work at several jobs. The one's outlined in my resume are jobs that I feel were very influential in my career path; each one leading me to the next.

               <strong><small>“Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You.” - Dr. Seuss</small></strong>
               <p> Native Wisconite currently residing in Phoenix, Arizona. My loyalties reside with the Milwaukee Bucks and Green Bay Packers, no questions asked.
                  I enjoy traveling and I love learning different languages. If we interview, ask me about the time I was almost kidnapped and South Korea. I'm an outdoors 
                  person so invite me out to hike if you are in need of a hiking buddy. Same for kayaking and running, as well. I might be able to sing a lick or two so Karaoke nights are also highly encouraged! 
                  Hidden talents include being able to eat an entire tub of ice cream by myself. This is a talent in which I have no shame. Mint chocolate chip. In case you were wondering.
